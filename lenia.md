# Lenia

## Introduction

Lenia is a continuous cellular automaton and a form of artificial life. It was created by Bert Wang-Chak Chan. Lenia extends Conway's Game of Life to a continuous domain, allowing for a much richer variety of complex patterns and behaviors.

## History

The Lenia project was initiated by Bert Wang-Chak Chan in 2015. It was first published on arXiv in 2018 and later in a peer-reviewed journal in 2019. The project has since gained popularity in the artificial life community and has inspired various extensions and research projects. Lenia has received several accolades, including being a Winner at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) in 2018, receiving an Honorable Mention at the ALIFE 2018 Art Award, and being named an Outstanding Publication of 2019 by the International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL).

## Core Concepts

Lenia is characterized by several key concepts that distinguish it from traditional cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life:

*   **Continuous Generalization:** Lenia is a continuous generalization of Conway's Game of Life, meaning that its states, space, and time are continuous rather than discrete.
*   **Continuous States:** Cells in Lenia can have any value between 0 and 1, representing a continuous range of states.
*   **Continuous Space and Time:** Lenia operates in a continuous space and time, allowing for smoother and more fluid patterns.
*   **Characteristics of Lenia Patterns:** Lenia patterns exhibit several unique characteristics:
    *   **Geometric:** Patterns often have clear geometric shapes.
    *   **Metameric:** Patterns can be composed of repeating segments.
    *   **Fuzzy:** Patterns can have soft or blurred edges.
    *   **Resilient:** Patterns can often recover from perturbations.
    *   **Adaptive:** Patterns can sometimes adapt to their environment.
    *   **Rule-Generic:** A wide variety of patterns can be generated by changing the rules.

## Mathematical Formulation

Lenia's dynamics are defined by an iterative update rule:

*   **Iterative Updates:** The state of each cell at the next time step is determined by its current state and the states of its neighbors.
*   **State Sets:** The state of each cell `A(x, t)` (or `A^t(x)`) at position `x` and time `t` is a real value, typically normalized to the range [0, 1].
*   **Neighborhoods:** The neighborhood `N(x)` of a cell `x` is typically a ball-like region centered at `x`.
*   **Local Rule:** The update rule is defined by a local rule `R`, which involves:
    *   **Convolution Kernel (K):** A kernel function that defines the influence of neighboring cells.
    *   **Growth Mapping (G):** A function that maps the convolved neighborhood state to a growth rate.
    The update process is as follows:
    1.  The potential distribution `U^t(x)` is calculated by convolving the kernel `K` with the current state `A^t(x)`:
        `U^t(x) = K * A^t(x)`
    2.  The growth distribution `G_map^t(x)` (using `G_map` to denote the growth mapping function to avoid confusion with the growth distribution itself) is then computed using the growth mapping function `G_map`:
        `growth_values^t(x) = G_map(U^t(x))`
    3.  The final state update is:
        `A^(t+Δt)(x) = clip(A^t(x) + Δt * growth_values^t(x), 0, 1)`
        where `Δt` is the time step and `clip(value, min, max)` ensures the state stays within the `[min, max]` range (here, [0, 1]).
*   **Kernel Generation:** The convolution kernel `K` is often generated from:
    *   **Kernel Shell (k_s):** Defines the basic shape of the kernel.
    *   **Kernel Skeleton (k_c):** Modulates the kernel shell to create more complex shapes.
*   **Growth Mappings:** The growth mapping `G_map` is typically a non-linear function, often a unimodal or multimodal function (e.g., Gaussian, bell-shaped curves), that determines how the cell's state changes based on the local environment's potential.

## Variations and Extensions

Several variations and extensions of Lenia have been developed, including:

*   **3D/4D Lenia:** Extends Lenia to three or four spatial dimensions.
*   **Multi-kernel Lenia:** Uses multiple convolution kernels to create more complex dynamics.
*   **Particle Lenia:** Introduces particle-like entities that interact with each other and the Lenia field.

## Applications and Research Directions

Lenia is being explored and applied in various research areas:

*   **Artificial Life Research:** Studying emergence, complexity, self-organization, and the conditions for life-like behavior.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Applications in evolutionary computation, neuroevolution, and generative systems.
*   **Theoretical Biology:** Modeling biological systems and processes.
*   **Computer Graphics and Art:** Generating novel and aesthetically pleasing patterns and animations.
